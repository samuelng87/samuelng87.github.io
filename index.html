          </center>
  <p>Earth is <b>4.5 billion</b> years old. In just a fraction of that time, 
    one species among countless others has conquered it: which is us.</p>
  
    <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Basically this page opens up with the origin of organisms from simple phenomena like energy, matter, 
      atoms and molecules. The chronological explanation given in this chapter regarding the coming of organisms into existence,
       confirm that organisms including Homo sapiens evolved from simple organisms into complex organisms. </p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbspOstensibly, the sapiens appeared the most intelligent organisms, and that explains why they formed their own cultures and later became 
      in charge of other organisms. </p>
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Besides, the presentation of systematic developments or revolution of human cultures and 
      societies presents evolution as an ongoing process. As a result, this convinces that organisms originated from simple organisms to become complex 
      organisms. This pictures humankind evolution as a process that is gradual, but makes tremendous transformations to human life.</p>
  <p>I hope you do enjoy my page and get most of the knowledge out of it, cheers!</p>

        <p>About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules.

                    <center> <p> <b>Myth</b></p> </center>
                    <p>Our chimpanzee cousins usually live in small troops of several dozen individuals. 
                      They form close friendships, hunt together and fight shoulder to shoulder against baboons, 
                      cheetahs and enemy chimpanzees. Their social structure tends to be hierarchical. The dominant member, 
                      who is almost always a male, is termed the ‘alpha male’. Other males and females exhibit their submission to 
                      the alpha male by bowing before him while making grunting sounds, not unlike human subjects kowtowing before a king. 
                      The alpha male strives to maintain social harmony within his troop. When two individuals fight, he will intervene and 
                      stop the violence. Less benevolently, he might monopolise particularly coveted foods and prevent lower-ranking males from 
                      mating with the females.</p>
            
                      <p>&nbsp &nbspWhen two males are contesting the alpha position, they usually do so by forming extensive coalitions of supporters, 
                        both male and female, from within the group. Ties between coalition members are based on intimate daily contact – hugging, 
                        touching, kissing, grooming and mutual favours. Just as human politicians on election campaigns go around shaking hands and 
                        kissing babies, so aspirants to the top position in a chimpanzee group spend much time hugging, back-slapping and kissing baby 
                        chimps. The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable 
                        coalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt struggles for the alpha position, but in almost all 
                        day-to-day activities. Members of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help one another in times of trouble.</p>
                    
                        <p>&nbsp &nbspThere are clear limits to the size of groups that can be formed and maintained in such a way. In order to function, 
                          all members of a group must know each other intimately. Two chimpanzees who have never met, never fought, and never engaged 
                          in mutual grooming will not know whether they can trust one another, whether it would be worthwhile to help one another, and 
                          which of them ranks higher. Under natural conditions, a typical chimpanzee troop consists of about twenty to fifty individuals. 
                          As the number of chimpanzees in a troop increases, the social order destabilises, eventually leading to a rupture and the formation
                           of a new troop by some of the animals. Only in a handful of cases have zoologists observed groups larger than a hundred. Separate 
                           groups seldom cooperate, and tend to compete for territory and food. Researchers have documented prolonged warfare between groups,
                            and even one case of ‘genocidal’ activity in which one troop systematically slaughtered most members of a neighbouring band.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp &nbspSimilar patterns probably dominated the social lives of early humans, including archaic Homo sapiens. Humans, 
              like chimps, have social instincts that enabled our ancestors to form friendships and hierarchies, and to hunt or fight 
              together. However, like the social instincts of chimps, those of humans were adapted only for small intimate groups. When 
              the group grew too large, its social order destabilised and the band split. Even if a particularly fertile valley could feed 
              500 archaic Sapiens, there was no way that so many strangers could live together. How could they agree who should be leader, who 
              should hunt where, or who should mate with whom?</p>
            
            
              <p>&nbsp &nbspIn the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, <span class="redwords">gossip</span> helped Homo sapiens to form larger and
                 more stable bands. But even gossip has its <span class="redwords">limits</span>. Sociological research has shown that the <span class="redwords">maximum</span>  
                 ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about <span class="redwords">150 individuals</span>. Most people can neither intimately know
                 , nor gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings.</p>
            
                 <p>&nbsp &nbspEven today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls somewhere around this magic number. Below this threshold, 
                   communities, businesses, social networks and military units can maintain themselves based mainly on intimate acquaintance and 
                   rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles and law books to keep order.3 A platoon of thirty soldiers or even a 
                   company of a hundred soldiers can function well on the basis of intimate relations, with a minimum of formal discipline. 
                   A well-respected sergeant can become ‘king of the company and exercise authority even over commissioned officers. A small 
                   family business can survive and flourish without a board of directors, a CEO or an accounting department.</p>
            
                   <p>&nbsp &nbspBut once the threshold of <span class="redwords">150 individuals is crossed</span>, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division
                      with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when 
                      they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.</p>
            
                      <p>&nbsp &nbsp<span class="redwords">How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold</span>, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands 
                        of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers 
                        of strangers can cooperate successfully by <span class="redwords">believing in common myths</span>.</p>
            
                        <p>&nbsp &nbspAny large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe
                           – is rooted in common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination. Churches are rooted in common religious 
                           myths. Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because 
                           they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins. States 
                           are rooted in common national myths. Two Serbs who have never met might risk their lives to save one another because both
                            believe in the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the Serbian flag. Judicial systems are rooted in
                             common legal myths. Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a complete stranger because 
                             they both believe in the existence of laws, justice, human rights – and the money paid out in fees.</p>

            <center> <p> <b>The Domestication of <span class="redwords">Fire</span>  </b></p> </center>
            
            <p>A significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire. Some human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as 800,000 years ago. Humans now had a dependable source of light and warmth, and a deadly weapon against prowling lions. Not long afterwards, humans may even have started deliberately to torch their neighbourhoods. A carefully managed fire could turn impassable barren thickets into prime grasslands teeming with game. In addition, once the fire died down, Stone Age entrepreneurs could walk through the smoking remains and harvest charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers.

            <p>&nbsp &nbspHumans now had a dependable source of light and warmth, and a deadly weapon against prowling lions. Not long afterwards, humans may even have started deliberately to torch their neighbourhoods. A carefully managed fire could turn impassable barren thickets into prime grasslands teeming with game. In addition, once the fire died down, Stone Age entrepreneurs could walk through the smoking remains and harvest charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbspBut the best thing fire did was cook. Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms – such as wheat, rice and potatoes – became staples of our diet thanks to cooking. Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, it changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. Humans also had a far easier time chewing and digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects and carrion if they were cooked. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbspThe advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens.
</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp &nbspFire also opened the first significant gulf between man and the other animals. The power of almost all animals depends on their bodies: the strength of their muscles, the size of their teeth, the breadth of their wings. Though they may harness winds and currents, they are unable to control these natural forces, and are always constrained by their physical design. Eagles, for example, identify thermal columns rising from the ground, spread their giant wings and allow the hot air to lift them upwards. Yet eagles cannot control the location of the columns, and their maximum carrying capacity is strictly proportional to their wingspan.
</p> <p>&nbsp &nbspWhen humans domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force. Unlike eagles, humans could choose when and where to ignite a flame, and they were able to exploit fire for any number of tasks. Most importantly, the power of fire was not limited by the form, structure or strength of the human body. A single woman with a flint or fire stick could burn down an entire forest in a matter of hours. The domestication of fire was a sign of things to come.

                        <p>FOR 2.5 MILLION YEARS HUMANS FED themselves by gathering plants and hunting animals that lived and bred without 
                          their intervention. Homo erectus, Homo ergaster and the Neanderthals plucked wild figs and hunted wild sheep without 
                          deciding where fig trees would take root, in which meadow a herd of sheep should graze, or which billy goat would 
                          inseminate which nanny goat. Homo sapiens spread from East Africa to the Middle East, to Europe and Asia, and 
                          finally to Australia and America – but everywhere they went, Sapiens too continued to live by gathering wild 
                          plants and hunting wild animals. Why do anything else when your lifestyle feeds you amply and supports a rich 
                          world of social structures, religious beliefs and political dynamics?</p>
                     
              
                          <p>&nbsp &nbspAll this changed about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to 
                            manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species. From sunrise to sunset humans sowed seeds, watered 
                            plants, plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to prime pastures. This work, they thought, would provide 
                            them with more fruit, grain and meat. It was a revolution in the way humans lived – the Agricultural Revolution.</p>
              
                          <p>&nbsp &nbspThe transition to agriculture began around 9500–8500 BC in the hill country of south-eastern Turkey, western Iran, 
                            and the Levant. It began slowly and in a restricted geographical area. Wheat and goats were domesticated by approximately 
                            9000 BC; peas and lentils around 8000 BC; olive trees by 5000 BC; horses by 4000 BC; and grapevines in 3500 BC. Some animals 
                            and plants, such as camels and cashew nuts, were domesticated even later, but by 3500 BC the main wave of domestication 
                            was over. Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come 
                            from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC – wheat, rice, maize (called ‘corn’ 
                            in the US), potatoes, millet and barley. No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years. 
                            If our minds are those of hunter-gatherers, our cuisine is that of ancient farmers.</p>
                       
                       
                        <p> &nbsp &nbspScholars once believed that agriculture spread from a single Middle Eastern point of origin to the four corners of the world. 
                          Today, scholars agree that agriculture sprang up in other parts of the world not by the action of Middle Eastern farmers exporting 
                          their revolution but entirely independently. People in Central America domesticated maize and beans without knowing anything 
                          about wheat and pea cultivation in the Middle East. South Americans learned how to raise potatoes and llamas, unaware of what 
                          was going on in either Mexico or the Levant. Chinas first revolutionaries domesticated rice, millet and pigs. North America’s 
                          first gardeners were those who got tired of combing the undergrowth for edible gourds and decided to cultivate pumpkins. 
                          New Guineans tamed sugar cane and bananas, while the first West African farmers made African millet, African rice, sorghum 
                          and wheat conform to their needs. From these initial focal points, agriculture spread far and wide. By the first century 
                          AD the vast majority of people throughout most of the world were agriculturists.</p>
                        
              
                        <p>&nbsp &nbspWhy did agricultural revolutions erupt in the Middle East, China and Central America but not in Australia, Alaska or South 
                          Africa? The reason is simple: most species of plants and animals can’t be domesticated. Sapiens could dig up delicious truffles 
                          and hunt down woolly mammoths, but domesticating either species was out of the question. The fungi were far too elusive, 
                          the giant beasts too ferocious. Of the thousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few were suitable 
                          candidates for farming and herding. Those few species lived in particular places, and those are the places where agricultural 
                          revolutions occurred.
              
                          Scholars once proclaimed that the agricultural revolution was a great leap forward for humanity. They told a tale of progress 
                          fuelled by human brain power. Evolution gradually produced ever more intelligent people. Eventually, people were so smart that 
                          they were able to decipher nature’s secrets, enabling them to tame sheep and cultivate wheat. As soon as this happened, 
                          they cheerfully abandoned the gruelling, dangerous, and often spartan life of hunter-gatherers, settling down to enjoy 
                          the pleasant, satiated life of farmers.</p>
              
                          <p>&nbsp &nbspThat tale is a fantasy. There is no evidence that people became more intelligent with time. Foragers knew the secrets of 
                            nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they 
                            hunted and the plants they gathered. Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers 
                            with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more 
                            stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly 
                            enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet 
                            or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder 
                            than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>
              
                            <p>&nbsp &nbspWho was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, 
                              rice and potatoes. <span class="redwords">These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.</span> </p>
              
                              <p>&nbsp &nbspThink for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the viewpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, 
                                one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the 
                                world. According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction, wheat has become one of the most successful 
                                plants in the history of the earth. In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 
                                10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of kilometres without encountering any other plant. 
                                Worldwide, wheat covers about 2.25 million square kilometres of the globes surface, almost ten times the size of Britain. 
                                How did this grass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous?</p>
              
                                <p>&nbsp &nbspWheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage. This ape had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and 
                                  gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort in cultivating wheat. Within a couple 
                                  of millennia, humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants. 
                                  It wasn’t easy. Wheat demanded a lot of them. Wheat didn’t like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs clearing 
                                  fields. Wheat didn’t like sharing its space, water and nutrients with other plants, so men and women laboured long days 
                                  weeding under the scorching sun. Wheat got sick, so Sapiens had to keep a watch out for worms and blight. Wheat was 
                                  defenceless against other organisms that liked to eat it, from rabbits to locust swarms, so the farmers had to 
                                  guard and protect it. Wheat was thirsty, so humans lugged water from springs and streams to water it. Its 
                                  hunger even impelled Sapiens to collect animal faeces to nourish the ground in which wheat grew.</p>
                        
                                  <p>&nbsp &nbspThe body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, 
                                    not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price. Studies of 
                                    ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such 
                                    as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time 
                                    that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely changed 
                                    their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‘domesticate’ 
                                    comes from the Latin domus, which means ‘house’. Who’s the one living in a house? Not 
                                    the wheat. It’s the Sapiens.</p>
              
                                    <p>&nbsp &nbspHow did wheat convince Homo sapiens to exchange a rather good life for a more miserable existence? What did it offer in return? 
                                      It did not offer a better diet. Remember, humans are omnivorous apes who thrive on a wide variety of foods. Grains made up 
                                      only a small fraction of the human diet before the Agricultural Revolution. A diet based on cereals is poor in minerals 
                                      and vitamins, hard to digest, and really bad for your teeth and gums.</p>
              
                                      <p>&nbsp &nbspWheat did not give people economic security. The life of a peasant is less secure than that of a hunter-gatherer. 
                                        Foragers relied on dozens of species to survive, and could therefore weather difficult years even without stocks 
                                        of preserved food. If the availability of one species was reduced, they could gather and hunt more of other 
                                        species. Farming societies have, until very recently, relied for the great bulk of their calorie intake on 
                                        a small variety of domesticated plants. In many areas, they relied on just a single staple, such as wheat, 
                                        potatoes or rice. If the rains failed or clouds of locusts arrived or if a fungus learned how to infect 
                                        that staple species, peasants died by the thousands and millions.</p>
              
              <p>&nbsp &nbspNor could wheat offer security against human violence. The early farmers were at least as violent as their forager 
                ancestors, if not more so. Farmers had more possessions and needed land for planting. The loss of pasture land to 
                raiding neighbours could mean the difference between subsistence and starvation, so there was much less room for 
                compromise. When a foraging band was hard-pressed by a stronger rival, it could usually move on. It was difficult 
                and dangerous, but it was feasible. When a strong enemy threatened an agricultural village, retreat meant giving 
                up fields, houses and granaries. In many cases, this doomed the refugees to starvation. Farmers, therefore, 
                tended to stay put and fight to the bitter end.</p>

                  <p class="smallwords">Tribal warfare in New Guinea between two farming communities (1960). Such scenes were probably widespread in 
                    the thousands of years following the Agricultural Revolution.</p> 
                </center>
              
               <p>&nbsp &nbspMany anthropological and archaeological studies indicate that in simple agricultural societies with no political frameworks beyond village and tribe, 
                 human violence was responsible for about 15 per cent of deaths, including 25 per cent of male deaths. In contemporary New Guinea, violence accounts 
                 for 30 per cent of male deaths in one agricultural tribal society, the Dani, and 35 per cent in another, the Enga. In Ecuador, perhaps 50 per cent 
                 of adult Waoranis meet a violent death at the hands of another human!3 In time, human violence was brought under control through the development 
                 of larger social frameworks – cities, kingdoms and states. But it took thousands of years to build such huge and effective political structures.</p>
              
                 <p>&nbsp &nbspVillage life certainly brought the first farmers some immediate benefits, such as better protection against wild animals, rain and cold. Yet for 
                   the average person, the disadvantages probably outweighed the advantages. This is hard for people in today’s prosperous societies to appreciate. 
                   Since we enjoy affluence and security, and since our affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we 
                   assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement. Yet it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from the perspective 
                   of today. A much more representative viewpoint is that of a three-year-old girl dying from malnutrition in first-century China because her 
                   father’s crops have failed. Would she say ‘I am dying from malnutrition, but in 2,000 years, people will have plenty to eat and live in big 
                   air-conditioned houses, so my suffering is a worthwhile sacrifice’?</p>
              
                   <p>&nbsp &nbspWhat then did wheat offer agriculturists, including that malnourished Chinese girl? It offered nothing for people as individuals. Yet it did 
                     bestow something on Homo sapiens as a species. Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo 
                     sapiensto multiply exponentially. Around 13,000 BC, when people fed themselves by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals, the 
                     area around the oasis of Jericho, in Palestine, could support at most one roaming band of about a hundred relatively healthy and 
                     well-nourished people. Around 8500 BC, when wild plants gave way to wheat fields, the oasis supported a large but cramped 
                     village of 1,000 people, who suffered far more from disease and malnourishment.</p>
                
                     <p>&nbsp &nbspThe currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company 
                       is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success 
                       of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a 
                       company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. 
                       From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the 
                       Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>
              
                       <p>&nbsp &nbspYet why should individuals care about this evolutionary calculus? Why would any sane person lower his or her standard of living just to 
                         multiply the number of copies of the Homo sapiens genome? Nobody agreed to this deal: the Agricultural Revolution was a trap.</p>

                <p>The first empire about which we have definitive information was the <span class="redwords">Akkadian Empire</span> of Sargon the Great (c.2250 BC). 
                  Sargon began his career as the <span class="redwords">king of Kish</span>, a small city state in Mesopotamia. Within a few decades he managed to conquer
                   not only all other Mesopotamian city states, but also large territories outside the Mesopotamian heartland. Sargon  
                   <span class="redwords">boasted</span>
                   that he had conquered the  
                              <span class="redwords">entire world.</span>
        
                   
                   In reality, his dominion stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, and 
                   included most of today’s Iraq and Syria, along with a few slices of modern Iran and Turkey.</p>
                
                   <p>&nbsp &nbspThe Akkadian Empire did not last long after its founder’s death, but Sargon left behind an imperial mantle that seldom 
                     remained unclaimed. For the next 1,700 years, Assyrian, Babylonian and Hittite kings adopted Sargon as a role model, 
                     <span class="redwords">boasting</span> that they, too, had conquered the <span class="redwords">entire world</span>. Then, around 550 BC, Cyrus the Great of Persia came along with 
                     an even more impressive boast.  </p>
        
                    <center>
                     <img class="image-in-words" src="https://erenow.net/common/sapiensbriefhistory/sapiensbriefhistory.files/image037.jpg"   alt="map">

                     <p>&nbsp &nbspThe kings of Assyria always remained the kings of Assyria. Even when they claimed to rule the entire world, it was 
                       obvious that they were doing it for the greater glory of Assyria, and they were not apologetic about it. Cyrus, on the 
                       other hand, claimed not merely to rule the whole world, but to do so for the sake of all people. ‘We are conquering you 
                       for your own benefit,’ said the Persians. Cyrus wanted the peoples he subjected to love him and to count themselves lucky 
                       to be Persian vassals. The most famous example of Cyrus’ innovative efforts to gain the approbation of a nation living under 
                       the thumb of his empire was his command that the Jewish exiles in Babylonia be allowed to return to their Judaean homeland 
                       and rebuild their temple. He even offered them financial assistance. Cyrus did not see himself as a Persian king ruling over 
                       Jews – he was also the king of the Jews, and thus responsible for their welfare.</p>
        
                       <p>&nbsp &nbspThe presumption to rule the entire world for the benefit of all its inhabitants was startling. Evolution has made Homo 
                         sapiens, like other social mammals, a xenophobic creature. Sapiens instinctively divide humanity into two parts, ‘we’ and 
                         ‘they’. We are people like you and me, who share our language, religion and customs. We are all responsible for each other, 
                         but not responsible for them. We were always distinct from them, and owe them nothing. We don’t want to see any of them in 
                         our territory, and we don’t care an iota what happens in their territory. They are barely even human. In the language of the 
                         Dinka people of the Sudan, ‘Dinka’ simply means ‘people’. People who are not Dinka are not people. The Dinka’s bitter enemies 
                         are the Nuer. What does the word Nuer mean in Nuer language? It means ‘original people’. Thousands of kilometres from the 
                         Sudan deserts, in the frozen ice-lands of Alaska and north-eastern Siberia, live the Yupiks. What does Yupik mean in Yupik 
                         language? It means ‘real people’.</p>
        
                         <p>&nbsp &nbspIn contrast with this ethnic exclusiveness, imperial ideology from Cyrus onward has tended to be inclusive and all-encompassing. 
                           Even though it has often emphasised racial and cultural differences between rulers and ruled, it has still recognised the basic 
                           unity of the <span class="redwords">entire world</span>, the existence of a single set of principles governing all places and times, and the mutual 
                           responsibilities of all human beings. Humankind is seen as a large family: the privileges of the parents go hand in hand with 
                           responsibility for the welfare of the children.</p>
                           <span class="redwords"></span>
                           <p>&nbsp &nbspThis new imperial vision passed from Cyrus and the Persians to Alexander the Great, and from him to Hellenistic kings, 
                             Roman emperors, Muslim caliphs, Indian dynasts, and eventually even to Soviet premiers and American presidents. This benevolent 
                             imperial vision has justified the existence of empires, and negated not only attempts by subject peoples to rebel, but also 
                             attempts by independent peoples to resist imperial expansion.</p>
        
                             <p>&nbsp &nbspSimilar imperial visions were developed independently of the Persian model in other parts of the world, most notably in Central 
                               America, in the Andean region, and in China. According to traditional Chinese political theory, <span class="redwords">Heaven (Tian)</span>  is the source of 
                               all legitimate authority on earth. Heaven chooses the most worthy person or family and gives them the Mandate of Heaven. 
                               This person or family then rules over All <span class="redwords">Under Heaven 天下 (Tianxia)</span> for the benefit of all its inhabitants. Thus, a legitimate 
                               authority is – by definition – universal. If a ruler lacks the Mandate of Heaven, then he lacks legitimacy to rule even a 
                               single city. If a ruler enjoys the mandate, he is obliged to spread justice and harmony to the entire world. The Mandate 
                               of Heaven could not be given to several candidates simultaneously, and consequently one could not legitimise the existence 
                               of more than one independent state.</p>
        
                               <p>&nbsp &nbspThe first emperor of the united Chinese empire, Qín Shǐ Huángdì, <span class="redwords">boasted</span> that ‘throughout the six directions [of the universe] 
                                 everything belongs to the emperor … wherever there is a human footprint, there is not one who did not become a 
                                 subject [of the emperor] … his kindness reaches even oxen and horses. There is not one who did not benefit. Every man 
                                 is safe under his own roof.’4 In Chinese political thinking as well as Chinese historical memory, imperial periods were 
                                 henceforth seen as golden ages of order and justice. In contradiction to the modern Western view that a just world 
                                 is composed of separate nation states, in China periods of political fragmentation were seen as dark ages of chaos 
                                 and injustice. This perception has had far-reaching implications for Chinese history. Every time an empire collapsed, 
                                 the dominant political theory goaded the powers that be not to settle for paltry independent principalities, but to 
                                 attempt reunification. Sooner or later these attempts always succeeded.</p>

                  <p> <b>The Discovery of Ignorance</b></p>
                 </center>
                <p>WERE, SAY, A SPANISH PEASANT TO HAVE fallen asleep in AD 1000 and woken up 500 years later, to the din of Columbus’ sailors boarding the Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria, the world would have seemed to him quite familiar. Despite many changes in technology, manners and political boundaries, this medieval Rip Van Winkle would have felt at home. But had one of Columbus’ sailors fallen into a similar slumber and woken up to the ringtone of a twenty-first-century iPhone, he would have found himself in a world strange beyond comprehension. ‘Is this heaven?’ he might well have asked himself. ‘Or perhaps – hell?’</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbspThe last 500 years have witnessed a phenomenal and unprecedented growth in human power. In the year 1500, there were about 500 million Homo sapiens in the entire world. Today, there are 7 billion.1 The total value of goods and services produced by humankind in the year 1500 is estimated at $250 billion, in today’s dollars.2 Nowadays the value of a year of human production is close to $60 trillion.3 In 1500, humanity consumed about 13 trillion calories of energy per day. Today, we consume 1,500 trillion calories a day.4 (Take a second look at those figures – human population has increased fourteen-fold, production 240-fold, and energy consumption 115-fold.)</p>   
                <p>&nbsp &nbspSuppose a single modern battleship got transported back to Columbus’ time. In a matter of seconds it could make driftwood out of the Niña, Pinta and Santa Maria and then sink the navies of every great world power of the time without sustaining a scratch. Five modern freighters could have taken onboard all the cargo borne by the whole world’s merchant fleets.5 A modern computer could easily store every word and number in all the codex books and scrolls in every single medieval library with room to spare. Any large bank today holds more money than all the world’s premodern kingdoms put together.6</p> 
                <p>&nbsp &nbspIn 1500, few cities had more than 100,000 inhabitants. Most buildings were constructed of mud, wood and straw; a three-storey building was a skyscraper. The streets were rutted dirt tracks, dusty in summer and muddy in winter, plied by pedestrians, horses, goats, chickens and a few carts. The most common urban noises were human and animal voices, along with the occasional hammer and saw. At sunset, the cityscape went black, with only an occasional candle or torch flickering in the gloom. If an inhabitant of such a city could see modern Tokyo, New York or Mumbai, what would she think?</p>
               <p>&nbsp &nbspPrior to the sixteenth century, no human had circumnavigated the earth. This changed in 1522, when Magellan’s expedition returned to Spain after a journey of 72,000 kilometres. It took three years and cost the lives of almost all the crew members, Magellan included. In 1873, Jules Verne could imagine that Phileas Fogg, a wealthy British adventurer, might just be able to make it around the world in eighty days. Today anyone with a middle-class income can safely and easily circumnavigate the globe in just forty-eight hours.</p>
               <p>&nbsp &nbspIn 1500, humans were confined to the earth’s surface. They could build towers and climb mountains, but the sky was reserved for birds, angels and deities. On 20 July 1969 humans landed on the moon. This was not merely a historical achievement, but an evolutionary and even cosmic feat. During the previous 4 billion years of evolution, no organism managed even to leave the earth’s atmosphere, and certainly none left a foot or tentacle print on the moon.</p>
                 <p>&nbsp &nbspFor most of history, humans knew nothing about 99.99 per cent of the organisms on the planet – namely, the microorganisms. This was not because they were of no concern to us. Each of us bears billions of one-celled creatures within us, and not just as free-riders. They are our best friends, and deadliest enemies. Some of them digest our food and clean our guts, while others cause illnesses and epidemics. Yet it was only in 1674 that a human eye first saw a microorganism, when Anton van Leeuwenhoek took a peek through his home-made microscope and was startled to see an entire world of tiny creatures milling about in a drop of water. During the subsequent 300 years, humans have made the acquaintance of a huge number of microscopic species. We’ve managed to defeat most of the deadliest contagious diseases they cause, and have harnessed microorganisms in the service of medicine and industry. Today we engineer bacteria to produce medications, manufacture biofuel and kill parasites.</p>
               <p>&nbsp &nbspBut the single most remarkable and defining moment of the past 500 years came at 05:29:45 on 16 July 1945. At that precise second, American scientists detonated the first atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico. From that point onward, humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history, but to end it.</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbspThe historical process that led to Alamogordo and to the moon is known as the Scientific Revolution. During this revolution humankind has obtained enormous new powers by investing resources in scientific research. It is a revolution because, until about AD 1500, humans the world over doubted their ability to obtain new medical, military and economic powers. While government and wealthy patrons allocated funds to education and scholarship, the aim was, in general, to preserve existing capabilities rather than acquire new ones. The typical premodern ruler gave money to priests, philosophers and poets in the hope that they would legitimise his rule and maintain the social order. He did not expect them to discover new medications, invent new weapons or stimulate economic growth.</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbspDuring the last five centuries, humans increasingly came to believe that they could increase their capabilities by investing in scientific research. This wasn’t just blind faith – it was repeatedly proven empirically. The more proofs there were, the more resources wealthy people and governments were willing to put into science. We would never have been able to walk on the moon, engineer microorganisms and split the atom without such investments. The US government, for example, has in recent decades allocated billions of dollars to the study of nuclear physics. The knowledge produced by this research has made possible the construction of nuclear power stations, which provide cheap electricity for American industries, which pay taxes to the US government, which uses some of these taxes to finance further research in nuclear physics.</p>

                      <p class="smallwords">The Scientific Revolution’s feedback loop. Science needs more than just research to make progress. It depends on the mutual reinforcement of science, politics and economics. Political and economic institutions provide the resources without which scientific research is almost impossible. In return, scientific research provides new powers that are used, among other things, to obtain new resources, some of which are reinvested in research.</p> 
                    
                      
                    </center>
                    <p>&nbsp &nbspIn 1687, Isaac Newton published the book, “The Mathematical Principle of Natural Philosophy”, arguably the most important book in modern science and perhaps in modern history. Newton presented in that book a general theory of all movements and changes in the world. The greatness of Newton’s theory was that it wasn’t full of  people who said this or did that but it tried to explain and predict all the movements of all the bodies in the Universe from an apple falling from a tree  to a shooting star, using just three, very simple mathematical laws. Newton calculated in the second of his three famous laws of motion that the force acting on a body is equal to the mass of the body multiplied by its acceleration. After Newton anyone who wished to understand and predict the movement of an apple, a cannonball, or a planet, simply had to make measurements of the mass and the acceleration of the object and of the forces acting on it and use Newton’s equation to predict its future position. Not all phenomena in the world can be reduced so neatly to an exact Newtonian equation. We don’t have exact equations, at least not yet, to understand evolution, economics, or human psychology, but, in these fields too, scientists combine empirical evidence to form general theories by means of mathematical tools. The main difference between psychology and Newtonian mechanics in physics, is that psychologists use statistics and probability instead of exact equations. Their mathematical tools are from different fields.</p>
                    
                    
                    <center><p> <b>Ignoramus</b></p>
                    </center>
                    
                      <p>Humans have sought to understand the universe at least since the Cognitive Revolution. Our ancestors put a great deal of time and effort into trying to discover the rules that govern the natural world. But modern science differs from all previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways:</p>      
                  <p><b>a. The willingness to admit ignorance. </b>  Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge.</p>
                <p> <b> b. The centrality of observation and mathematics. </b> Having admitted ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge. It does so by gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these observations into comprehensive theories.</p>  
                <p> <b> c. The acquisition of new powers.</b> Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies.</p>
                <p>The Scientific Revolution has not been a revolution of knowledge. It has been above all a revolution of ignorance. The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.</p>

                      <p> <b>The Wheels of Industry</b></p>
                     </center>
                       
                    <p>THE MODERN ECONOMY GROWS THANKS to our trust in the future and to the willingness of capitalists to reinvest their 
                      profits in production. Yet that does not suffice. Economic growth also requires energy and raw materials, and these 
                      are finite. When and if they run out, the entire system will collapse. </p>
              
                      <p>&nbsp &nbsp But the evidence provided by the past is that they are finite only in theory. 
                      Counter-intuitively, while humankind’s use of energy and raw materials has mushroomed 
                      in the last few centuries, the amounts available for our exploitation have actually increased. 
                      Whenever a shortage of either has threatened to slow economic growth, investments have flowed into 
                      scientific and technological research. These have invariably produced not only more efficient ways of 
                      exploiting existing resources, but also completely new types of energy and materials.</p>
                    
                       <p>&nbsp&nbspConsider the vehicle industry. Over the last 300 years, humankind has manufactured billions of vehicles – from carts and wheelbarrows, to trains, cars, supersonic jets and space shuttles. One might have expected that such a prodigious effort would have exhausted the energy sources and raw materials available for vehicle production, and that today we would be scraping the bottom of the barrel. Yet the opposite is the case. Whereas in 1700 the global vehicle industry relied overwhelmingly on wood and iron, today it has at its disposal a cornucopia of new-found materials such as plastic, rubber, aluminium and titanium, none of which our ancestors even knew about. Whereas in 1700 carts were built mainly by the muscle power of carpenters and smiths, today the machines in Toyota and Boeing factories are powered by petroleum combustion engines and nuclear power stations. A similar revolution has swept almost all other fields of industry. We call it the Industrial Revolution.</p>
                       <p>&nbsp&nbspFor millennia prior to the Industrial Revolution, humans already knew how to make use of a large variety of energy sources. They burned wood in order to smelt iron, heat houses and bake cakes. Sailing ships harnessed wind power to move around, and watermills captured the flow of rivers to grind grain. Yet all these had clear limits and problems. Trees were not available everywhere, the wind didn’t always blow when you needed it, and water power was only useful if you lived near a river.</p>
                       <p>&nbsp&nbspAn even bigger problem was that people didn’t know how to convert one type of energy into another. They could harness the movement of wind and water to sail ships and push millstones, but not to heat water or smelt iron. Conversely, they could not use the heat energy produced by burning wood to make a millstone move. Humans had only one machine capable of performing such energy conversion tricks: the body. In the natural process of metabolism, the bodies of humans and other animals burn organic fuels known as food and convert the released energy into the movement of muscles. Men, women and beasts could consume grain and meat, burn up their carbohydrates and fats, and use the energy to haul a rickshaw or pull a plough.</p>
                       <p>&nbsp&nbspSince human and animal bodies were the only energy conversion device available, muscle power was the key to almost all human activities. Human muscles built carts and houses, ox muscles ploughed fields, and horse muscles transported goods. The energy that fuelled these organic muscle-machines came ultimately from a single source – plants. Plants in their turn obtained their energy from the sun. By the process of photosynthesis, they captured solar energy and packed it into organic compounds. Almost everything people did throughout history was fuelled by solar energy that was captured by plants and converted into muscle power.</p>
                       <p>&nbsp&nbspHuman history was consequently dominated by two main cycles: the growth cycles of plants and the changing cycles of solar energy (day and night, summer and winter). When sunlight was scarce and when wheat fields were still green, humans had little energy. Granaries were empty, tax collectors were idle, soldiers found it difficult to move and fight, and kings tended to keep the peace. When the sun shone brightly and the wheat ripened, peasants harvested the crops and filled the granaries. Tax collectors hurried to take their share. Soldiers flexed their muscles and sharpened their swords. Kings convened councils and planned their next campaigns. Everyone was fuelled by solar energy – captured and packaged in wheat, rice and potatoes.</p>

                      </center>
              <p>The Industrial Revolution yielded an unprecedented combination of cheap and abundant energy and cheap and abundant raw materials. The result was an explosion in human productivity. The explosion was felt first and foremost in agriculture. Usually, when we think of the Industrial Revolution, we think of an urban landscape of smoking chimneys, or the plight of exploited coal miners sweating in the bowels of the earth. Yet the Industrial Revolution was above all else the Second Agricultural Revolution.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspDuring the last 200 years, industrial production methods became the mainstay of agriculture. Machines such as tractors began to undertake tasks that were previously performed by muscle power, or not performed at all. Fields and animals became vastly more productive thanks to artificial fertilisers, industrial insecticides and an entire arsenal of hormones and medications. Refrigerators, ships and aeroplanes have made it possible to store produce for months, and transport it quickly and cheaply to the other side of the world. Europeans began to dine on fresh Argentinian beef and Japanese sushi.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspEven plants and animals were mechanised. Around the time that Homo sapiens was elevated to divine status by humanist religions, farm animals stopped being viewed as living creatures that could feel pain and distress, and instead came to be treated as machines. Today these animals are often mass-produced in factory-like facilities, their bodies shaped in accordance with industrial needs. They pass their entire lives as cogs in a giant production line, and the length and quality of their existence is determined by the profits and losses of business corporations. Even when the industry takes care to keep them alive, reasonably healthy and well fed, it has no intrinsic interest in the animals’ social and psychological needs (except when these have a direct impact on production).</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspEgg-laying hens, for example, have a complex world of behavioural needs and drives. They feel strong urges to scout their environment, forage and peck around, determine social hierarchies, build nests and groom themselves. But the egg industry often locks the hens inside tiny coops, and it is not uncommon for it to squeeze four hens to a cage, each given a floor space of about twenty-five by twenty-two centimetres. The hens receive sufficient food, but they are unable to claim a territory, build a nest or engage in other natural activities. Indeed, the cage is so small that hens are often unable even to flap their wings or stand fully erect.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspPigs are among the most intelligent and inquisitive of mammals, second perhaps only to the great apes. Yet industrialised pig farms routinely confine nursing sows inside such small crates that they are literally unable to turn around (not to mention walk or forage). The sows are kept in these crates day and night for four weeks after giving birth. Their offspring are then taken away to be fattened up and the sows are impregnated with the next litter of piglets.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspMany dairy cows live almost all their allotted years inside a small enclosure; standing, sitting and sleeping in their own urine and excrement. They receive their measure of food, hormones and medications from one set of machines, and get milked every few hours by another set of machines. The cow in the middle is treated as little more than a mouth that takes in raw materials and an udder that produces a commodity. Treating living creatures possessing complex emotional worlds as if they were machines is likely to cause them not only physical discomfort, but also much social stress and psychological frustration.</p>

Male chicks and imperfect female chicks are picked off the conveyor belt and are then asphyxiated in gas chambers, dropped into automatic shredders, or simply thrown into the rubbish, where they are crushed to death. Hundreds of millions of chicks die each year in such hatcheries.</p>
               </center>
              <p>Just as the Atlantic slave trade did not stem from hatred towards Africans, so the modern animal industry is not motivated by animosity. Again, it is fuelled by indifference. Most people who produce and consume eggs, milk and meat rarely stop to think about the fate of the chickens, cows or pigs whose flesh and emissions they are eating. Those who do think often argue that such animals are really little different from machines, devoid of sensations and emotions, incapable of suffering. Ironically, the same scientific disciplines which shape our milk machines and egg machines have lately demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that mammals and birds have a complex sensory and emotional make-up. They not only feel physical pain, but can also suffer from emotional distress.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspEvolutionary psychology maintains that the emotional and social needs of farm animals evolved in the wild, when they were essential for survival and reproduction. For example, a wild cow had to know how to form close relations with other cows and bulls, or else she could not survive and reproduce. In order to learn the necessary skills, evolution implanted in calves – as in the young of all other social mammals – a strong desire to play (playing is the mammalian way of learning social behaviour). And it implanted in them an even stronger desire to bond with their mothers, whose milk and care were essential for survival.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspWhat happens if farmers now take a young calf, separate her from her mother, put her in a closed cage, give her food, water and inoculations against diseases, and then, when she is old enough, inseminate her with bull sperm? From an objective perspective, this calf no longer needs either maternal bonding or playmates in order to survive and reproduce. But from a subjective perspective, the calf still feels a very strong urge to bond with her mother and to play with other calves. If these urges are not fulfilled, the calf suffers greatly. This is the basic lesson of evolutionary psychology: a need shaped in the wild continues to be felt subjectively even if it is no longer really necessary for survival and reproduction. The tragedy of industrial agriculture is that it takes great care of the objective needs of animals, while neglecting their subjective needs.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspThe truth of this theory has been known at least since the 1950s, when the American psychologist Harry Harlow studied the development of monkeys. Harlow separated infant monkeys from their mothers several hours after birth. The monkeys were isolated inside cages, and then raised by dummy mothers. In each cage, Harlow placed two dummy mothers. One was made of metal wires, and was fitted with a milk bottle from which the infant monkey could suck. The other was made of wood covered with cloth, which made it resemble a real monkey mother, but it provided the infant monkey with no material sustenance whatsoever. It was assumed that the infants would cling to the nourishing metal mother rather than to the barren cloth one.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspTo Harlow’s surprise, the infant monkeys showed a marked preference for the cloth mother, spending most of their time with her. When the two mothers were placed in close proximity, the infants held on to the cloth mother even while they reached over to suck milk from the metal mother. Harlow suspected that perhaps the infants did so because they were cold. So he fitted an electric bulb inside the wire mother, which now radiated heat. Most of the monkeys, except for the very young ones, continued to prefer the cloth mother.</p>

                <p class="smallwords">One of Harlow’s orphaned monkeys clings to the cloth mother even while sucking milk from the metal mother.</p>
              </center>
              <p>Follow-up research showed that Harlow’s orphaned monkeys grew up to be emotionally disturbed even though they had received all the nourishment they required. They never fitted into monkey society, had difficulties communicating with other monkeys, and suffered from high levels of anxiety and aggression. The conclusion was inescapable: monkeys must have psychological needs and desires that go beyond their material requirements, and if these are not fulfilled, they will suffer greatly. Harlow’s infant monkeys preferred to spend their time in the hands of the barren cloth mother because they were looking for an emotional bond and not only for milk. In the following decades, numerous studies showed that this conclusion applies not only to monkeys, but to other mammals, as well as birds. At present, millions of farm animals are subjected to the same conditions as Harlow’s monkeys, as farmers routinely separate calves, kids and other youngsters from their mothers, to be raised in isolation.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspAltogether, tens of billions of farm animals live today as part of a mechanised assembly line, and about 50 billion of them are slaughtered annually. These industrial livestock methods have led to a sharp increase in agricultural production and in human food reserves. Together with the mechanisation of plant cultivation, industrial animal husbandry is the basis for the entire modern socio-economic order. Before the industrialisation of agriculture, most of the food produced in fields and farms was ‘wasted’ feeding peasants and farmyard animals. Only a small percentage was available to feed artisans, teachers, priests and bureaucrats. Consequently, in almost all societies peasants comprised more than 90 per cent of the population. Following the industrialisation of agriculture, a shrinking number of farmers was enough to feed a growing number of clerks and factory hands. Today in the United States, only 2 per cent of the population makes a living from agriculture, yet this 2 per cent produces enough not only to feed the entire US population, but also to export surpluses to the rest of the world.9 Without the industrialisation of agriculture the urban Industrial Revolution could never have taken place – there would not have been enough hands and brains to staff factories and offices.</p>
              <p>&nbsp&nbspAs those factories and offices absorbed the billions of hands and brains that were released from fieldwork, they began pouring out an unprecedented avalanche of products. Humans now produce far more steel, manufacture much more clothing, and build many more structures than ever before. In addition, they produce a mind-boggling array of previously unimaginable goods, such as light bulbs, mobile phones, cameras and dishwashers. For the first time in human history, supply began to outstrip demand. And an entirely new problem was born: who is going to buy all this stuff?</p>

                <p> <b>The Age of Shopping</b></p>
               </center>
                     <p>The modern capitalist economy must constantly increase production if it is to survive, like a shark that must swim or suffocate. Yet it’s not enough just to produce. Somebody must also buy the products, or industrialists and investors alike will go bust. To prevent this catastrophe and to make sure that people will always buy whatever new stuff industry produces, a new kind of ethic appeared: consumerism.</p>
                     <p>&nbsp&nbspMost people throughout history lived under conditions of scarcity. Frugality was thus their watchword. The austere ethics of the Puritans and Spartans are but two famous examples. A good person avoided luxuries, never threw food away, and patched up torn trousers instead of buying a new pair. Only kings and nobles allowed themselves to renounce such values publicly and conspicuously flaunt their riches.</p>
                     <p>&nbsp&nbspConsumerism sees the consumption of ever more products and services as a positive thing. It encourages people to treat themselves, spoil themselves, and even kill themselves slowly by overconsumption. Frugality is a disease to be cured. You don’t have to look far to see the consumer ethic in action – just read the back of a cereal box. Here’s a quote from a box of one of my favourite breakfast cereals, produced by an Israeli firm, Telma:</p>
                     <p>Sometimes you need a treat. Sometimes you need a little extra energy. There are times to watch your weight and times when you’ve just got to have something … right now! Telma offers a variety of tasty cereals just for you – treats without remorse.</p>
                     <p>The same package sports an ad for another brand of cereal called Health Treats:</p>
                     <p>Health Treats offers lots of grains, fruits and nuts for an experience that combines taste, pleasure and health. For an enjoyable treat in the middle of the day, suitable for a healthy lifestyle. A real treat with the wonderful taste of more [emphasis in the original].</p>
                     <p>Throughout most of history, people were likely to be have been repelled rather than attracted by such a text. They would have branded it as selfish, decadent and morally corrupt. Consumerism has worked very hard, with the help of popular psychology (‘Just do it!’) to convince people that indulgence is good for you, whereas frugality is self-oppression.</p>
                     <p>&nbsp&nbspIt has succeeded. We are all good consumers. We buy countless products that we don’t really need, and that until yesterday we didn’t know existed. Manufacturers deliberately design short-term goods and invent new and unnecessary models of perfectly satisfactory products that we must purchase in order to stay ‘in’. Shopping has become a favourite pastime, and consumer goods have become essential mediators in relationships between family members, spouses and friends. Religious holidays such as Christmas have become shopping festivals. In the United States, even Memorial Day – originally a solemn day for remembering fallen soldiers – is now an occasion for special sales. Most people mark this day by going shopping, perhaps to prove that the defenders of freedom did not die in vain.</p>
                     <p>&nbsp&nbspThe flowering of the consumerist ethic is manifested most clearly in the food market. Traditional agricultural societies lived in the awful shade of starvation. In the affluent world of today one of the leading health problems is obesity, which strikes the poor (who stuff themselves with hamburgers and pizzas) even more severely than the rich (who eat organic salads and fruit smoothies). Each year the US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all the hungry people in the rest of the world. Obesity is a double victory for consumerism. Instead of eating little, which will lead to economic contraction, people eat too much and then buy diet products – contributing to economic growth twice over.</p>
                     <p>&nbsp&nbspHow can we square the consumerist ethic with the capitalist ethic of the business person, according to which profits should not be wasted, and should instead be reinvested in production? It’s simple. As in previous eras, there is today a division of labour between the elite and the masses. In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally, minding every penny. Today, the tables have turned. The rich take great care managing their assets and investments, while the less well heeled go into debt buying cars and televisions they don’t really need.</p>
                     <p>&nbsp&nbspThe capitalist and consumerist ethics are two sides of the same coin, a merger of two commandments. The supreme commandment of the rich is ‘Invest!’ The supreme commandment of the rest of us is ‘Buy!’</p>
                     <p>&nbsp&nbspThe capitalist-consumerist ethic is revolutionary in another respect. Most previous ethical systems presented people with a pretty tough deal. They were promised paradise, but only if they cultivated compassion and tolerance, overcame craving and anger, and restrained their selfish interests. This was too tough for most. The history of ethics is a sad tale of wonderful ideals that nobody can live up to. Most Christians did not imitate Christ, most Buddhists failed to follow Buddha, and most Confucians would have caused Confucius a temper tantrum.</p>
                     <p>&nbsp&nbspIn contrast, most people today successfully live up to the capitalist-consumerist ideal. The new ethic promises paradise on condition that the rich remain greedy and spend their time making more money, and that the masses give free rein to their cravings and passions – and buy more and more. This is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do. How, though, do we know that we’ll really get paradise in return? We’ve seen it on television.</p>

                     <p>THE LAST 500 YEARS HAVE WITNESSED A breathtaking series of revolutions. The earth has been united into a single ecological and historical sphere. The economy has grown exponentially, and humankind today enjoys the kind of wealth that used to be the stuff of fairy tales. Science and the Industrial Revolution have given humankind superhuman powers and practically limitless energy. The social order has been completely transformed, as have politics, daily life and human psychology.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspBut are we happier? Did the wealth humankind accumulated over the last five centuries translate into a new-found contentment? Did the discovery of inexhaustible energy resources open before us inexhaustible stores of bliss? Going further back, have the seventy or so turbulent millennia since the Cognitive Revolution made the world a better place to live? Was the late Neil Armstrong, whose footprint remains intact on the windless moon, happier than the nameless hunter-gatherer who 30,000 years ago left her handprint on a wall in Chauvet Cave? If not, what was the point of developing agriculture, cities, writing, coinage, empires, science and industry?
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspHistorians seldom ask such questions. They do not ask whether the citizens of Uruk and Babylon were happier than their foraging ancestors, whether the rise of Islam made Egyptians more pleased with their lives, or how the collapse of the European empires in Africa have influenced the happiness of countless millions. Yet these are the most important questions one can ask of history. Most current ideologies and political programmes are based on rather flimsy ideas concerning the real source of human happiness. Nationalists believe that political self-determination is essential for our happiness. Communists postulate that everyone would be blissful under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Capitalists maintain that only the free market can ensure the greatest happiness of the greatest number, by creating economic growth and material abundance and by teaching people to be self-reliant and enterprising.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspWhat would happen if serious research were to disprove these hypotheses? If economic growth and self-reliance do not make people happier, what’s the benefit of Capitalism? What if it turns out that the subjects of large empires are generally happier than the citizens of independent states and that, for example, Algerians were happier under French rule than under their own? What would that say about the process of decolonisation and the value of national self-determination?
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspThese are all hypothetical possibilities, because so far historians have avoided raising these questions – not to mention answering them. They have researched the history of just about everything politics, society, economics, gender, diseases, sexuality, food, clothing – yet they have seldom stopped to ask how these influence human happiness.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspThough few have studied the long-term history of happiness, almost every scholar and layperson has some vague preconception about it. In one common view, human capabilities have increased throughout history. Since humans generally use their capabilities to alleviate miseries and fulfil aspirations, it follows that we must be happier than our medieval ancestors, and they must have been happier than Stone Age hunter-gatherers.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspBut this progressive account is unconvincing. As we have seen, new aptitudes, behaviours and skills do not necessarily make for a better life. When humans learned to farm in the Agricultural Revolution, their collective power to shape their environment increased, but the lot of many individual humans grew harsher. Peasants had to work harder than foragers to eke out less varied and nutritious food, and they were far more exposed to disease and exploitation. Similarly, the spread of European empires greatly increased the collective power of humankind, by circulating ideas, technologies and crops, and opening new avenues of commerce. Yet this was hardly good news for millions of Africans, Native Americans and Aboriginal Australians. Given the proven human propensity for misusing power, it seems naïve to believe that the more clout people have, the happier they will be.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspSome challengers of this view take a diametrically opposed position. They argue for a reverse correlation between human capabilities and happiness. Power corrupts, they say, and as humankind gained more and more power, it created a cold mechanistic world ill-suited to our real needs. Evolution moulded our minds and bodies to the life of hunter-gatherers. The transition first to agriculture and then to industry has condemned us to living unnatural lives that cannot give full expression to our inherent inclinations and instincts, and therefore cannot satisfy our deepest yearnings. Nothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class can approach the wild excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on a successful mammoth hunt. Every new invention just puts another mile between us and the Garden of Eden.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspYet this romantic insistence on seeing a dark shadow behind each invention is as dogmatic as the belief in the inevitability of progress. Perhaps we are out of touch with our inner hunter-gatherer, but it’s not all bad. For instance, over the last two centuries modern medicine has decreased child mortality from 33 per cent to less than 5 per cent. Can anyone doubt that this made a huge contribution to the happiness not only of those children who would otherwise have died, but also of their families and friends?
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspA more nuanced position takes the middle road. Until the Scientific Revolution there was no clear correlation between power and happiness. Medieval peasants may indeed have been more miserable than their hunter-gatherer forebears. But in the last few centuries humans have learned to use their capacities more wisely. The triumphs of modern medicine are just one example. Other unprecedented achievements include the steep drop in violence, the virtual disappearance of international wars, and the near elimination of large-scale famines.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspYet this, too, is an oversimplification. Firstly, it bases its optimistic assessment on a very small sample of years. The majority of humans began to enjoy the fruits of modern medicine no earlier than 1850, and the drastic drop in child mortality is a twentieth-century phenomenon. Mass famines continued to blight much of humanity up to the middle of the twentieth century. During Communist Chinas Great Leap Forward of 1958–61, somewhere between 10 and 50 million human beings starved to death. International wars became rare only after 1945, largely thanks to the new threat of nuclear annihilation. Hence, though the last few decades have been an unprecedented golden age for humanity, it is too early to know whether this represents a fundamental shift in the currents of history or an ephemeral eddy of good fortune. When judging modernity, it is all too tempting to take the viewpoint of a twenty-first-century middle-class Westerner. We must not forget the viewpoints of a nineteenth-century Welsh coal miner, Chinese opium addict or Tasmanian Aborigine. Truganini is no less important than Homer Simpson.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspSecondly, even the brief golden age of the last half-century may turn out to have sown the seeds of future catastrophe. Over the last few decades, we have been disturbing the ecological equilibrium of our planet in myriad new ways, with what seem likely to be dire consequences. A lot of evidence indicates that we are destroying the foundations of human prosperity in an orgy of reckless consumption.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspFinally, we can congratulate ourselves on the unprecedented accomplishments of modern Sapiens only if we completely ignore the fate of all other animals. Much of the vaunted material wealth that shields us from disease and famine was accumulated at the expense of laboratory monkeys, dairy cows and conveyor-belt chickens. Over the last two centuries tens of billions of them have been subjected to a regime of industrial exploitation whose cruelty has no precedent in the annals of planet Earth. If we accept a mere tenth of what animal-rights activists are claiming, then modern industrial agriculture might well be the greatest crime in history. When evaluating global happiness, it is wrong to count the happiness only of the upper classes, of Europeans or of men. Perhaps it is also wrong to consider only the happiness of humans.

                      <p> <b>Counting Happiness</b></p>
                     </center>
              
                     <p>So far we have discussed happiness as if it were largely a product of material factors, such as health, diet and wealth. If people are richer and healthier, then they must also be happier. But is that really so obvious? Philosophers, priests and poets have brooded over the nature of happiness for millennia, and many have concluded that social, ethical and spiritual factors have as great an impact on our happiness as material conditions. Perhaps people in modern affluent societies suffer greatly from alienation and meaninglessness despite their prosperity. And perhaps our less well-to-do ancestors found much contentment in community, religion and a bond with nature.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspIn recent decades, psychologists and biologists have taken up the challenge of studying scientifically what really makes people happy. Is it money, family, genetics or perhaps virtue? The first step is to define what is to be measured. The generally accepted definition of happiness is ‘subjective well-being’. Happiness, according to this view, is something I feel inside myself, a sense of either immediate pleasure or long-term contentment with the way my life is going. If it’s something felt inside, how can it be measured from outside? Presumably, we can do so by asking people to tell us how they feel. So psychologists or biologists who want to assess how happy people feel give them questionnaires to fill out and tally the results.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspA typical subjective well-being questionnaire asks interviewees to grade on a scale of zero to ten their agreement with statements such as ‘I feel pleased with the way I am’, ‘I feel that life is very rewarding’, ‘I am optimistic about the future’ and ‘Life is good’. The researcher then adds up all the answers and calculates the interviewee’s general level of subjective well-being.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspSuch questionnaires are used in order to correlate happiness with various objective factors. One study might compare a thousand people who earn $100,000 a year with a thousand people who earn $50,000. If the study discovers that the first group has an average subjective well-being level of 8.7, while the latter has an average of only 7.3, the researcher may reasonably conclude that there is a positive correlation between wealth and subjective well-being. To put it in simple English, money brings happiness. The same method can be used to examine whether people living in democracies are happier than people living in dictatorships, and whether married people are happier than singles, divorcees or widowers.
              
                    </p>
                     <p> This provides a grounding for historians, who can examine wealth, political freedom and divorce rates in the past. If people are happier in democracies and married people are happier than divorcees, a historian has a basis for arguing that the democratisation process of the last few decades contributed to the happiness of humankind, whereas the growing rates of divorce indicate an opposite trend.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>This way of thinking is not flawless, but before pointing out some of the holes, it is worth considering the findings.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspOne interesting conclusion is that money does indeed bring happiness. But only up to a point, and beyond that point it has little significance. For people stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder, more money means greater happiness. If you are an American single mother earning $12,000 a year cleaning houses and you suddenly win $500,000 in the lottery, you will probably experience a significant and long-term surge in your subjective well-being. You’ll be able to feed and clothe your children without sinking further into debt. However, if you’re a top executive earning $250,000 a year and you win $1 million in the lottery, or your company board suddenly decides to double your salary, your surge is likely to last only a few weeks. According to the empirical findings, it’s almost certainly not going to make a big difference to the way you feel over the long run. You’ll buy a snazzier car, move into a palatial home, get used to drinking Chateau Pétrus instead of California Cabernet, but it’ll soon all seem routine and unexceptional.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspAnother interesting finding is that illness decreases happiness in the short term, but is a source of long-term distress only if a person’s condition is constantly deteriorating or if the disease involves ongoing and debilitating pain. People who are diagnosed with chronic illness such as diabetes are usually depressed for a while, but if the illness does not get worse they adjust to their new condition and rate their happiness as highly as healthy people do. Imagine that Lucy and Luke are middle-class twins, who agree to take part in a subjective well-being study. On the way back from the psychology laboratory, Lucy’s car is hit by a bus, leaving Lucy with a number of broken bones and a permanently lame leg. Just as the rescue crew is cutting her out of the wreckage, the phone rings and Luke shouts that he has won the lottery’s $10,000,000 jackpot. Two years later she’ll be limping and he’ll be a lot richer, but when the psychologist comes around for a follow-up study, they are both likely to give the same answers they did on the morning of that fateful day.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspFamily and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is particularly important. Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being, and between bad marriages and misery. This holds true irrespective of economic or even physical conditions. An impecunious invalid surrounded by a loving spouse, a devoted family and a warm community may well feel better than an alienated billionaire, provided that the invalid’s poverty is not too severe and that his illness is not degenerative or painful.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspThis raises the possibility that the immense improvement in material conditions over the last two centuries was offset by the collapse of the family and the community. If so, the average person might well be no happier today than in 1800. Even the freedom we value so highly may be working against us. We can choose our spouses, friends and neighbours, but they can choose to leave us. With the individual wielding unprecedented power to decide her own path in life, we find it ever harder to make commitments. We thus live in an increasingly lonely world of unravelling communities and families.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspBut the most important finding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations. If you want a bullock-cart and get a bullock-cart, you are content. If you want a brand-new Ferrari and get only a second-hand Fiat you feel deprived. This is why winning the lottery has, over time, the same impact on people’s happiness as a debilitating car accident. When things improve, expectations balloon, and consequently even dramatic improvements in objective conditions can leave us dissatisfied. When things deteriorate, expectations shrink, and consequently even a severe illness might leave you pretty much as happy as you were before.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>You might say that we didn’t need a bunch of psychologists and their questionnaires to discover this. Prophets, poets and philosophers realised thousands of years ago that being satisfied with what you already have is far more important than getting more of what you want. Still, it’s nice when modern research – bolstered by lots of numbers and charts – reaches the same conclusions the ancients did.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspThe crucial importance of human expectations has far-reaching implications for understanding the history of happiness. If happiness depended only on objective conditions such as wealth, health and social relations, it would have been relatively easy to investigate its history. The finding that it depends on subjective expectations makes the task of historians far harder. We moderns have an arsenal of tranquillisers and painkillers at our disposal, but our expectations of ease and pleasure, and our intolerance of inconvenience and discomfort, have increased to such an extent that we may well suffer from pain more than our ancestors ever did.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspIt’s hard to accept this line of thinking. The problem is a fallacy of reasoning embedded deep in our psyches. When we try to guess or imagine how happy other people are now, or how people in the past were, we inevitably imagine ourselves in their shoes. But that won’t work because it pastes our expectations on to the material conditions of others. In modern affluent societies it is customary to take a shower and change your clothes every day. Medieval peasants went without washing for months on end, and hardly ever changed their clothes. The very thought of living like that, filthy and reeking to the bone, is abhorrent to us. Yet medieval peasants seem not to have minded. They were used to the feel and smell of a long-unlaundered shirt. It’s not that they wanted a change of clothes but couldn’t get it – they had what they wanted. So, at least as far as clothing goes, they were content.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspThat’s not so surprising, when you think of it. After all, our chimpanzee cousins seldom wash and never change their clothes. Nor are we disgusted by the fact that our pet dogs and cats don’t shower or change their coats daily. We pat, hug and kiss them all the same. Small children in affluent societies often dislike showering, and it takes them years of education and parental discipline to adopt this supposedly attractive custom. It is all a matter of expectations.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspIf happiness is determined by expectations, then two pillars of our society – mass media and the advertising industry – may unwittingly be depleting the globe’s reservoirs of contentment. If you were an eighteen-year-old youth in a small village 5,000 years ago you’d probably think you were good-looking because there were only fifty other men in your village and most of them were either old, scarred and wrinkled, or still little kids. But if you are a teenager today you are a lot more likely to feel inadequate. Even if the other guys at school are an ugly lot, you don’t measure yourself against them but against the movie stars, athletes and supermodels you see all day on television, Facebook and giant billboards.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspSo maybe Third World discontent is fomented not merely by poverty, disease, corruption and political oppression but also by mere exposure to First World standards. The average Egyptian was far less likely to die from starvation, plague or violence under Hosni Mubarak than under Ramses II or Cleopatra. Never had the material condition of most Egyptians been so good. You’d think they would have been dancing in the streets in 2011, thanking Allah for their good fortune. Instead they rose up furiously to overthrow Mubarak. They weren’t comparing themselves to their ancestors under the pharaohs, but rather to their contemporaries in Obama’s America.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspIf that’s the case, even immortality might lead to discontent. Suppose science comes up with cures for all diseases, effective anti-ageing therapies and regenerative treatments that keep people indefinitely young. In all likelihood, the immediate result will be an unprecedented epidemic of anger and anxiety.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspThose unable to afford the new miracle treatments – the vast majority of people – will be beside themselves with rage. Throughout history, the poor and oppressed comforted themselves with the thought that at least death is even-handed – that the rich and powerful will also die. The poor will not be comfortable with the thought that they have to die, while the rich will remain young and beautiful for ever.
              
                    </p>
                     <p>&nbspBut the tiny minority able to afford the new treatments will not be euphoric either. They will have much to be anxious about. Although the new therapies could extend life and youth, they cannot revive corpses. How dreadful to think that I and my loved ones can live for ever, but only if we don’t get hit by a truck or blown to smithereens by a terrorist! Potentially a-mortal people are likely to grow averse to taking even the slightest risk, and the agony of losing a spouse, child or close friend will be unbearable.

                           </center>
                    <p>There is another new technology which could change the laws of 
                      life: cyborg engineering. Cyborgs are beings which combine organic and 
                      inorganic parts, such as a human with bionic hands. In a sense, nearly all 
                      of us are bionic these days, since our natural senses and functions are supplemented 
                      by devices such as eyeglasses, pacemakers, orthotics, and even computers and mobile phones 
                      (which relieve our brains of some of their data storage and processing burdens). We stand poised 
                      on the brink of becoming true cyborgs, of having inorganic features that are inseparable from our bodies, 
                      features that modify our abilities, desires, personalities and identities.

                    </p>
                    <p>&nbspThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a US military research 
                      agency, is developing cyborgs out of insects. The idea is to implant electronic chips, 
                      detectors and processors in the body of a fly or cockroach, which will enable either a 
                      human or an automatic operator to control the insect’s movements remotely and to absorb 
                      and transmit information. Such a fly could be sitting on the wall at enemy headquarters, 
                      eavesdrop on the most secret conversations, and if it isn’t caught first by a spider, could 
                      inform us exactly what the enemy is planning.12 In 2006 the US Naval Undersea Warfare Center 
                      reported its intention to develop cyborg sharks, declaring, ‘NUWC is developing a fish tag whose 
                      goal is behaviour control of host animals via neural implants.’ The developers hope to identify underwater 
                      electromagnetic fields made by submarines and mines, by exploiting the natural magnetic detecting capabilities 
                      of sharks, which are superior to those of any man-made detectors.13

                    </p>
                    <p>&nbspSapiens, too, are being turned into cyborgs. The newest generation of hearing aids are sometimes 
                      referred to as ‘bionic ears’. The device consists of an implant that absorbs sound through a microphone l
                      ocated in the outer part of the ear. The implant filters the sounds, identifies human voices, and translates 
                      them into electric signals that are sent directly to the central auditory nerve and from there to the brain.14

                    </p>
                    <p>&nbspRetina Implant, a government-sponsored German company, is developing a retinal 
                      prosthesis that may allow blind people to gain partial vision. It involves implanting a 
                      small microchip inside the patient’s eye. Photocells absorb light falling on the eye and 
                      transform it into electrical energy, which stimulates the intact nerve cells in the retina. 
                      The nervous impulses from these cells stimulate the brain, where they are translated into sight. 
                      At present the technology allows patients to orientate themselves in space, identify letters, and 
                      even recognise faces.15

                    <p>&nbspJesse Sullivan, an American electrician, lost both arms up to the shoulder 
                      in a 2001 accident. Today he uses two bionic arms, courtesy of the Rehabilitation 
                      Institute of Chicago. The special feature of Jesse’s new arms is that they are operated 
                      by thought alone. Neural signals arriving from Jesse’s brain are translated by micro-computers 
                      into electrical commands, and the arms move. When Jesse wants to raise his arm, he does what any 
                      normal person unconsciously does – and the arm rises. These arms can perform a much more limited range 
                      of movements than organic arms, but they enable Jesse to carry out simple daily functions. A similar bionic 
                      arm has recently been outfitted for Claudia Mitchell, an American soldier who lost her arm in a motorcycle 
                      accident. Scientists believe that we will soon have bionic arms that will not only move when willed to move, 
                      but will also be able to transmit signals back to the brain, thereby enabling amputees to regain even the 
                      sensation of touch!

                    <p>&nbspAt present these bionic arms are a poor replacement for our organic originals, but they have the potential for unlimited development. Bionic arms, for example, can be made far more powerful than their organic kin, making even a boxing champion feel like a weakling. Moreover, bionic arms have the advantage that they can be replaced every few years, or detached from the body and operated at a distance.

                    </p>
                    <p>&nbspScientists at Duke University in North Carolina have recently demonstrated this with rhesus monkeys whose brains have been implanted with electrodes. The electrodes gather signals from the brain and transmit them to external devices. The monkeys have been trained to control detached bionic arms and legs through thought alone. One monkey, named Aurora, learned to thought-control a detached bionic arm while simultaneously moving her two organic arms. Like some Hindu goddess, Aurora now has three arms, and her arms can be located in different rooms – or even cities. She can sit in her North Carolina lab, scratch her back with one hand, scratch her head with a second hand, and simultaneously steal a banana in New York (although the ability to eat a purloined fruit at a distance remains a dream). Another rhesus monkey, Idoya, won world fame in 2008 when she thought-controlled a pair of bionic legs in Kyoto, Japan, from her North Carolina chair. The legs were twenty times Idoya’s weight.17

                    <p>&nbspLocked-in syndrome is a condition in which a person loses all or nearly all her ability to move any part of her body, while her cognitive abilities remain intact. Patients suffering from the syndrome have up till now been able to communicate with the outside world only through small eye movements. However, a few patients have had brain-signal-gathering electrodes implanted in their brains. Efforts are being made to translate such signals not merely into movements but also into words. If the experiments succeed, locked-in patients could finally speak directly with the outside world, and we might eventually be able to use the technology to read other peoples minds.18

                    </p>
                    <p>&nbspYet of all the projects currently under development, the most revolutionary is the attempt to devise a direct two-way brain-computer interface that will allow computers to read the electrical signals of a human brain, simultaneously transmitting signals that the brain can read in turn. What if such interfaces are used to directly link a brain to the Internet, or to directly link several brains to each other, thereby creating a sort of Inter-brain-net? What might happen to human memory, human consciousness and human identity if the brain has direct access to a collective memory bank? In such a situation, one cyborg could, for example, retrieve the memories of another – not hear about them, not read about them in an autobiography, not imagine them, but directly remember them as if they were his own. Or her own. What happens to concepts such as the self and gender identity when minds become collective? How could you know thyself or follow your dream if the dream is not in your mind but in some collective reservoir of aspirations?

                    </p>
                    <p>&nbspSuch a cyborg would no longer be human, or even organic. It would be something completely different. It would be so fundamentally another kind of being that we cannot even grasp the philosophical, psychological or political implications.

                    </p>

<p>The third way to change the laws of life is to engineer completely inorganic beings. The most obvious examples are computer programs and computer viruses that can undergo independent evolution.

</p>
<p>&nbspThe field of genetic programming is today one of the most interesting spots in the computer science world. It tries to emulate the methods of genetic evolution. Many programmers dream of creating a program that could learn and evolve completely independently of its creator. In this case, the programmer would be a primum mobile, a first mover, but his creation would be free to evolve in directions neither its maker nor any other human could ever have envisaged.

</p>
<p>&nbspA prototype for such a program already exists – it’s called a computer virus. As it spreads through the Internet, the virus replicates itself millions upon millions of times, all the while being chased by predatory antivirus programs and competing with other viruses for a place in cyberspace. One day when the virus replicates itself a mistake occurs – a computerised mutation. Perhaps the mutation occurs because the human engineer programmed the virus to make occasional random replication mistakes. Perhaps the mutation was due to a random error. If, by chance, the modified virus is better at evading antivirus programs without losing its ability to invade other computers, it will spread through cyberspace. If so, the mutants will survive and reproduce. As time goes by, cyberspace would be full of new viruses that nobody engineered, and that undergo non-organic evolution.

</p>
<p>&nbspAre these living creatures? It depends on what you mean by ‘living creatures’. They have certainly been produced by a new evolutionary process, completely independent of the laws and limitations of organic evolution.

</p>
<p>&nbspImagine another possibility – suppose you could back up your brain to a portable hard drive and then run it on your laptop. Would your laptop be able to think and feel just like a Sapiens? If so, would it be you or someone else? What if computer programmers could create an entirely new but digital mind, composed of computer code, complete with a sense of self, consciousness and memory? If you ran the program on your computer, would it be a person? If you deleted it could you be charged with murder?

</p>
<p>&nbspWe might soon have the answer to such questions. The Human Brain Project, founded in 2005, hopes to recreate a complete human brain inside a computer, with electronic circuits in the computer emulating neural networks in the brain. The projects director has claimed that, if funded properly, within a decade or two we could have an artificial human brain inside a computer that could talk and behave very much as a human does. If successful, that would mean that after 4 billion years of milling around inside the small world of organic compounds, life will suddenly break out into the vastness of the inorganic realm, ready to take up shapes beyond our wildest dreams. Not all scholars agree that the mind works in a manner analogous to today’s digital computers – and if it doesn’t, present-day computers would not be able to simulate it. Yet it would be foolish to categorically dismiss the possibility before giving it a try. In 2013 the project received a grant of €1 billion from the European Union.19
